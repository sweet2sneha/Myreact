The <Link> and <NavLink> are the components provided by react-router-dom to navigate around the react application. Generally, we use anchor tags for this purpose while navigating. Then what’s the difference? Let’s find out.
npm install react-responsive-carousel
npm install react-icons
Anchor tags will reload the page and re-render all the components. While <Link> and <NavLink> will only re-render updated components matched with the URL path of the Route without reloading. It helps the Single-Page Applications to work faster while routing.

<Link> Component Props:

to: String or object which specifies the pathname.
replace: Replaces the pathname in the history stack with new.
innerRef: Passes ref to the element rendered by the component.
<NavLink> Component Props:


to, replace, innerRef same as the Link Component.
className: Specifies the CSS class name you want to apply to the element when active.
isActive: Returns boolean value whether the link is active or not.
style: To apply inline CSS.
end: Match the pathname precisely with the URL.
